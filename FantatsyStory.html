    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What is the POV of the work? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; The POV for the work is the MC who has transmigrated into this ruthless world as an Extra. </p>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What is the kind of character arc that the MC will go through in the entire story? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; At the starting the MC wants to gain power so that he can save himself from the horrors of the world. </p>
    <p> &emsp; When asked the question, <b>Who do you serve?</b> His response would be <b>Myself!</b>. </p>
    <p> &emsp; An arrogant response in a world where the fates of hunters are tied closely together.</p>
    <p> &emsp; When asked the same question at the end, his response will still be <b>Myself!</b> </p>
    <p> &emsp; But <i>"Myself"</i> here includes everyone around him and the people he is connected with. </p>
    <ul>
        <div style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">
        <p>
            In the beginning the MC is a simple human.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end the MC becomes a being that is spread across several creatures.
        </p>
    
        </div>
    </ul>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What is the question the work aims to raise and answer by the end? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; In a world as messed up as Eldoria, where hunters are constantly hunted by the beyond- </p>
    <p> &emsp; Where the normal people are constantly taken to face the reconining- </p>
    <p> &emsp; What does it mean to hold the <i> <b> Key to salvation </b> </i> ? A key that can be used only if you sacrifice your sense of self. </p>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What does the world look like? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp;     <img src="WorldMapPlainPowerRegionLabled.png.png" alt="World Map" style="width:854px;height:480px;">    </p>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What powers the magic of this world? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; Magic of this world is powered by mana. </p>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> How does magic in this world work? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; Magic works differently for different races. </p>
    <p> &emsp; For humans, magic is performed by inscribing runes onto their souls. </p>
    <p> &emsp; The better they understand their rune and the more resonance there is between the rune and their soul, the better and stronger their magic. </p>
    <p> &emsp; Each rune allows people the possibility to edit the various parameters of the world. </p>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What are the parameters that Magic can interact with? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; Parameters are the basic runic compositions eeach and every item in the world can be represented with. </p>
    <p> &emsp; For example, the position parameter of an object, which can be manipulated to teleport around the object by someone with a space rune. </p>
    <p> &emsp; Someone with a vibration rune could also cause the position of atoms of the object to vibrate and make it extremely hot or cold by dampning vibration. </p>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What are the distinct phases of Human magic Runic Manipulation Magic? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; Magic for humans is classified into seven distinct phases. </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <p> <b> Rune manifestation. </b> : Rune manifestation involves simply passing mana to the rune and causing its basic effect to occur.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Object Parameter Manipulation. </b> : Various parameters of inanimate objects can be manipulated. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Understanding Manipulation. </b> : Rune effects can be controlled by implying personal understanding of the rune's effect. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> World Parameter Manipulation. </b> : Parameters of the world can be modified, like time, space, temperature, humidity, etc.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Soul Property Manipulation. </b> : Runes can be used to modify the properties of souls based on personal understanding.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Mana Property Manipulation. </b> : Runes can be used to manipulate the properties of mana directly, making it harder for other people to control their own mana.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Domain Expansion. </b> : Runes can be used to create a domain where personal understanding of the person about their rune is the only way it works.</p> </li>
    </ol>
    <p> &emsp; Each phase of runic manipulation magic is deeply personal to each human and is based on their understanding of the rune engraved into their soul. </p>

    <li><p style="display: inline;"> <b> What are the distinct categories of Human magic Runic Manipulation Magic? </b> </p></li>
    <p> &emsp; Magic for humans is categoriesed into four different categories based on how unique the magic is to its user. </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <p> <b> Wand Magister </b> : These magisters use wands made up of magical creature souls to manipulate mana easier by basing magic on their intent. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Body Magister </b> : These magisters use their bodies to directly manipulate mana and manifest spells based on their runes. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Devotion Magister : These magisters pray to a deity to pass their intent along to the deity such that they can cast spells in the domain of their deity. </b> </p> </li>
        <li> <p> <b> Soul Magister (Deity) </b> : These magisters have successfully created domains of their own magic where they can strictly implement the understanding of their runes. </p> </li>
    </ol>
